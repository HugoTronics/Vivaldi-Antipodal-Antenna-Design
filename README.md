## :rocket: Getting Started

### Files Included

1. **DXF Files**: 
    - `Antenna\DXF\BOT`: Bottom design of the antenna for PCB milling.
    - `Antenna\DXF\TOP`: Top design of the antenna for PCB milling.
    - `Antenna\DXF\EDGE`: Border design of the antenna for PCB milling.

2. **STL Files**:
    - `Antenna Case\STL-SOLIDWORK\Vivaldi_Antenna_Enclosure`: 3D model for the support structure of the antenna.
    - `Antenna Case\STL-SOLIDWORK\Vivaldi_Antenna_Cover`: 3D model for the support structure of the antenna.

3. **Simulation Files**:
   - `CST Studio design\Vivaldi_Antenna.cst`: CST Studio simulation files used to test and optimize the antenna performance.

### How to Use

1. **Download the Files**:
   - Clone this repository or download the files directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HugoTronics/Vivaldi-Antipodal-Antenna-Design).

2. **Open DXF Files**:
   - Use a CAD software like AutoCAD or Fusion 360 to view and modify the DXF files for PCB manufacturing.

3. **3D Print STL Files**:
   - Use any 3D printer compatible with STL files to print the support structure. Recommended material is PETG for durability.

4. **Simulate with CST Studio**:
   - Load the CST Studio simulation file to perform your own design and optimization checks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1. **Antenna Design**:
   - Import the DXF file into your PCB design software and prepare it for milling.

2. **3D Printing**:
   - Open the STL file in your 3D printing software and adjust settings according to your printer's specifications. Print the support structure.

3. **Simulation**:
   - Open the CST Studio file to explore simulation results and optimize the design as needed.

## :test_tube: Testing and Validation

1. **Fabrication**:
   - Fabricate the antenna using the DXF design files and assemble it with the 3D-printed support.

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test the antenna's performance using a vector network analyzer (VNA) and compare with simulation results.

3. **Real-World Testing**:
   - Install the antenna and test signal reception improvements with your 4G/5G box.

## :memo: Documentation and References

- **CST Studio Suite**: For antenna design simulations.
- **Opensignal App**: For antenna orientation optimization.
- **Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)**: For real-world performance measurements.
